# Real-world example

# Imagine you go to a tea shop üçµ:

# Normal way (without with):

# You order a cup, drink it, and you must remember to return the cup.

# With with:

# You order chai using a ‚Äúchai service,‚Äù drink it, and the waiter automatically takes the cup back for you.

# You don‚Äôt need to worry about cleanup.
